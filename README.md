# Insulin pump simulator

An open source simulation model of the mechanical properties of a fully functional insulin pump made in Matlab Simscape. The model simulates realistic behavior of the pump, parts of which are validated against real-world data. Simulations include mechanical forces and internal pressures, and the following fluid dynamics. Failure modes, such as occlusions, can be simulated and the resulting simulations can give new insights on how these failures affects the pump and how to detect them. 

The simulator can be used to improve currently available insulin-glucose simulation models, and can also be used to improve the safety and reliability of insulin pumps by providing a tool for the development of novel methods for infusion failure detection. 

The project was made as part of a Master's thesis for biomedical cybernetics course (TTK4900) at NTNU related to implementing additional safety features to an Artificial Pancreas system, such as improved occlusion detection. Made in conjunction with Artificial Pancreas Trondheim (APT).
