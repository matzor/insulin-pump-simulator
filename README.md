Simulation of the physical mechanisms of an insulin pump. Made as part of a Master's thesis for biomedical cybernetics course (TTK4900) at NTNU related to implementing additional safety features to an Artificial Pancreas system, such as improved occlusion detection. Made in conjunction with Artificial Pancreas Trondheim (APT).
